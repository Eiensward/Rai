  `SHREK: Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. (he holds out his onion)

  DONKEY: (sniffs the onion) They stink?
  
  SHREK: Yes - - No!
  
  DONKEY: They make you cry?
  
  SHREK: No!
  
  DONKEY: Oh, you leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.
  
  SHREK: No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he throws away the onion and walks off)`,
  `Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
  I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
  She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
  In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
  Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
  Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
  Didn't make sense not to live for fun
  Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
  So much to do, so much to see
  So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
  You'll never know if you don't go
  You'll never shine if you don't glow
  Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
  Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
  And all that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars break the mold
  It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
  You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
  But the meteor men beg to differ
  Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
  The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
  The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
  My world's on fire, how about yours?
  That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
  Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
  Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
  All that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars break the mold
  Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
  Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
  And all that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars
  Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
  I need to get myself away from this place
  I said, "Yup" what a concept
  I could use a little fuel myself
  And we could all use a little change
  Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
  Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
  Didn't make sense not to live for fun
  Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
  So much to do, so much to see
  So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
  You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
  You'll never shine if you don't glow
  Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
  Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
  And all that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars break the mold
  And all that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars break the mold`,
  `To be, or not to be, that is the question:
  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
  And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
  No more; and by a sleep to say we end
  The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
  That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
  To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
  Must give us pause—there's the respect
  That makes calamity of so long life.
  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
  Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
  The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
  The insolence of office, and the spurns
  That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
  When he himself might his quietus make
  With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
  To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
  But that the dread of something after death,
  The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
  No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
  And makes us rather bear those ills we have
  Than fly to others that we know not of?
  Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,
  And thus the native hue of resolution
  Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
  And enterprises of great pith and moment
  With this regard their currents turn awry
  And lose the name of action.`,

  She keep playing me dumb (play me)
  I'ma play her for fun (uh-huh)
  Y'all don't really know my mental
  Lemme give you the picture like stencil
  Falling out, in a drought
  No flow, rain wasn't pouring down (pouring down)
  See, that pain was all around
  See, my mode was kinda lounged
  Didn't know which-which way to turn
  Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
  Energy up, you can feel my surge
  I'ma kill everything like this purge (ayy)
  Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work
  Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (get it)
  Everything that I do is electric
  I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it moving like kinetic, ayy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
  Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
  Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
  Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
  Have you walkin' on a plank, la-la-la-la-la, like
  Both hands together, God, let me pray (now let me pray)
  Uh, I've been going right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
  Pass the baton, back to them all
  Swimming in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh
  Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
  Can you please read between the lines?
  My rhyme's inclined to break your spine
  They say that I'm so fine
  You could never match my grind (true)
  Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)
